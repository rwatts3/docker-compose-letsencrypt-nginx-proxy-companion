# Web Proxy using Docker, NGINX and Let's Encrypt

With this repo you will be able to set up your server with multiple sites using a single NGINX proxy to manage your connections, automating your apps container (port 80 and 443) to auto renew your ssl certificates with Let´s Encrypt.

Something like:



![Web Proxy environment](https://github.com/evertramos/images/raw/master/webproxy.jpg)


## Why use it?

Using this set up you will be able start a production environment in a few seconds. And to start new web project simply start new containers the option `-e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com` and will be ready to go, if you want to use SSL (Let's Encrypt) just add the tag `-e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com`. Done!

Easy and trustworthy!


## Prerequisites

In order to use this compose file (docker-compose.yml) you must have:

1. docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
2. docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## How to use it

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evertramos/docker-compose-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion.git
```

2. Make a copy of our `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`:

Update this file with your preferences.

```
#
# WEBPROXY
#
# A Web Proxy using docker with NGINX with Let's Encrypt
# And our great community docker-gen, nginx-proxy and docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
#
# This is the .env file to set up your webproxy environment

# Define the names for your local containers
NGINX_WEB=nginx-web
DOCKER_GEN=nginx-gen
LETS_ENCRYPT=nginx-letsencrypt

# Your external IP address
IP=0.0.0.0

# Network name
NETWORK=webproxy

# NGINX file path
NGINX_FILES_PATH=/path/to/your/nginx/data
```

4. Run our start script

```bash
# ./run.sh
```

Your proxy is ready to go!

## Starting your web containers

After following the steps above you can start new web containers with port 80 open and add the option `-e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com` so proxy will automatically generate the reverse script in NGINX Proxy to forward new connections to your web/app container, as of:

```bash
docker run -d -e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com \
              --network=webproxy \
              --name my_app \
              httpd:alpine
```

To have SSL in your web/app you just add the option `-e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com`, as follow:

```bash
docker run -d -e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com \
              -e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com \
              -e LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your.email@your.domain.com \
              --network=webproxy \
              --name my_app \
              httpd:alpine
```

> You don´t need to open port *443* in your container, the certificate validation is managed by the web proxy.


> Please note that when running a new container to generate certificates with LetsEncrypt (`-e LETSENCRYPT_HOST=your.domain.com`), it may take a few minutes, depending on multiples circunstances.


## Testing your proxy with scripts preconfigured 

1. Run the script `test.sh` informing your domain already configured in your DNS to point out to your server as follow:

```bash
# ./test.sh your.domain.com
```

or simply run:

```bash
 docker run -dit -e VIRTUAL_HOST=your.domain.com --network=webproxy --name test-web httpd:alpine
```

Access your browser with your domain!

To stop and remove your test container run our `stop_test.sh` script:

```bash
# ./stop_test.sh
```

Or simply run:

```bash
docker stop test-web && docker rm test-web 
```

## Production Environment using Web Proxy and Wordpress

1. [wordpress-docker-letsencrypt](https://github.com/evertramos/wordpress-docker-letsencrypt)
2. [docker-portainer-letsencrypt](https://github.com/evertramos/docker-portainer-letsencrypt)

In this repo you will find a docker-compose file to start a production environment for a new wordpress site.
